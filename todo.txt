General:
1 - Remove prints.


Code generation:
1 - io function arguments are not being parsed (possibly same error as 2):
  In file correct/array1
    Should be "invokestatic io/print(Ljava/lang/String;I)V"
    Output is "invokestatic io/print(Ljava/lang/String)V"

2 - function arguments missing in calls (probably only the first or last one is missing):
  In file correct/array1
    Should be "invokestatic array1/print_array(I)V"
    Output is "invokestatic array1/print_array()V"
  In file correct/aval1
    Should be "invokestatic aval1/f(II)I"
    Output is "invokestatic aval1/f(I)I"

3 - compiler crashes on certain files:
  correct/aval2
  correct/aval3
  correct/aval4
  correct/aval5
  correct/aval6
  correct/aval7
  correct/aval8
  correct/library1
  correct/max_array
  correct/max
  correct/max1
  correct/maxmin
  correct/programa1
  correct/programa2
  correct/programa3
  correct/sqrt
  extra/call-main
  extra/error-uninitialized-output
  extra/nested-branch
  extra/stack-size

4 - negative constants being treated as positive:
  In file test/constant-ranges
    Should be "sipush -129"
    Output is "ldc 129"

5 - missing '(' in function call (could be related to problems 1 and 2):
  In file test/constant-ranges
    Should be "invokestatic constantRanges/f()V"
    Output is "invokestatic constantRanges/f)V"
