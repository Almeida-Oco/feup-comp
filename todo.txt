Code generation:
1 - Fkin yal rules that do not make sense...
    Need to add the rule for the case:
      a = [2];
      a = 1;  //All positions of array initialized to 1


Code Generation Peculiarities:
  1 - test/correct/aval3.yal
    main() allocates 'a' to 3 and 'b' to 1 ???

  2 - test/correct/programa3.yal
    66:0 - 'astore 4' shouldn't it be 'astore 2' ???
