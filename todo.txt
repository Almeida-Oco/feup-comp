General:
1 - Remove prints.

Semantic check:
  Case when function does not initialize return variable!


Code generation:
1 - compiler crashes on certain files:
  correct/programa1
  correct/sqrt
  extra/call-main
  extra/error-uninitialized-output

2 - Given generated files have some weird peculiarities
  test/correct/aval3.yal
    main() allocates 'a' to local 3, and 'b' to 1 ???

  test/correct/aval4.yal
    No code generated???

2 - negative constants being treated as positive:
  In file test/constant-ranges
    Should be "sipush -129"
    Output is "ldc 129"

3 - Module variable use getstatic and putstatic
    correct/programa1

4 - Add code for 'clinit'
    correct/programa1

5 - Fkin yal rules that do not make sense...
    Need to add the rule for the case:
      a = [2];
      a = 1;  //All positions of array initialized to 1

5 - Do we need to generate code to handle calls to external modules???
    correct/programa1

6 - Println should be able to have any type of parameters:
  In aval1 (same in aval2, aval3, ...)
    Should be "invokestatic io/println(I)V"
    Output is "invokestatic io/println(Ljava/lang/String;)V"
